    "description": "This agent acts as a comprehensive interface for the Google Workspace ecosystem and associated Google APIs. It provides extensive capabilities to manage and automate tasks across Gmail (sending, organizing, retrieving), Google Drive (file management, search, permission handling, content generation), and Google Calendar (schedule management). It features deep integration with Google Classroom for managing courses, assignments, and rosters, as well as Google Analytics for reporting. Additionally, it controls Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides for document creation and data manipulation. Advanced features include RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) via File Search stores, image generation, YouTube video summarization, and Google Maps utilities. It serves as a central hub for executing complex workflows involving multiple Google services.",
